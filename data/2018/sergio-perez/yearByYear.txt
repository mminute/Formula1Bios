2017


Retains his seventh in the standings in a season in which he often finds himself locked in battle with new, rookie team mate Esteban Ocon. Ultimately has the upper hand on the Mercedes protege, but misses out on a podium for the first time since 2013.

2016


Podium form continues with third places on the street circuits of Monaco and Baku, as he finishes a career-best seventh in the standings and helps Force India to their strongest season showing to date. 

2015


Points prove hard to come by over the first eight races, but the arrival of Force India’s B-spec car in the ninth provides the springboard for an excellent run which includes eight top-10 finishes in the final 11 rounds and a fifth career rostrum in Russia.

2014


Acquits himself well against highly-rated Force India team mate Hulkenberg, admittedly in a season of highs and lows that includes a podium finish in Bahrain and a self-inflicted retirement in Hungary. Scores in 12 of 19 races to finish 10th overall.

2013


Quiet start to life at McLaren ends with battling run to sixth in Bahrain where he races wheel-to-wheel with team mate Button. Inconsistency and an unexpectedly uncompetitive car means he betters that result just once, with fifth place in India. Moves to Force India for 2014.

2012


Second season with Sauber one of highs and lows. Podium finishes in Malaysia and Canada contrast with low-key results elsewhere, as car and driver search for consistency. Signs for McLaren for 2013 after fine second place in Italy, before performances slump a little.

2011


Seventh on F1 race debut with Sauber before car disqualified on technical grounds. Scores first points at round five. Misses Monaco after qualifying crash, and sits out subsequent Canadian race. Then impresses sufficiently to be retained for 2012.

2010


GP2 Series runner-up, with five wins, seven podiums, one pole position and six fastest laps. Tests for BMW Sauber F1 team after landing race drive for 2011.

2009


Twelfth overall in GP2 Series, with two podiums and one fastest lap. Fifteenth overall in GP2 Asia.

2008


Seventh overall in GP2 Asia series, with two wins, three podiums and one fastest lap. Fourth overall in British Formula Three championship, with four wins, seven podiums and one fastest lap.

2007


British Formula Three National champion.

2006


Sixth overall in Formula BMW ADAC series. Represents Mexico in the two A1GP races.

2005


Fourteenth overall in Formula BMW ADAC series, with one podium.
